### ðŸš¨ The app is still in Development !!
<br>

## Overview

Manelo offers an amazing experience of reading manga on your desktop.

Of course, I would never dream of offering any illegal content. So, you won't find any copyrighted manga on this app. Only free, legal manga.

And I'm sure that no one will be able to figure out how to add their own manga to the app themselves.

### Anticipated features

- A clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to search, browse, and read your favorite manga.
- Offline reading mode to read your manga without an internet connection. Which you definitely haven't illegally obtained.
- Bookmarking and note-taking to keep track of your progress.
- Automatic updates to never miss an update of your favorite manga. Which you definitely haven't illegally obtained.
- Customizable reading settings. So you can make the reading experience as comfortable as possible.

Stay tuned for more updates on our development progress!
